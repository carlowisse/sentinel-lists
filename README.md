## Getting Started
**Sentinel Lists requires Git LFS to clone**

A few of the compiled lists are very large and therefore require Git LFS. **It is not necessary to clone this repository** unless you would like to make edits (see below for contributing instructions), you can simply link to the RAW files hosted on GitHub if you wish to use them.

<br>

## How To Clone
> You will need **Git LFS**

1. Download & Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
2. Set up Git LFS for your user
    ```
    git lfs install
    ```
    > **You only need to do this once per user account**
3. Now you can clone or fork the repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/carlowisse/sentinel-lists.git
    ```

## Issues
If there are any issues with domains, regexes or scripts, please raise an issue on the issue tab and I will look into it. This includes lists that might be missing domains that you think are needed to deny a service or ads.

If you have found or created an awesome domains list, please raise an issue and paste it in that issue, I will look into adding it!
